# Steam-SyncUp
Steam SyncUp enables users to find and join a game community, tailored to their specific game. By linking their Steam account, users can discuss, chat, and meet new users through the chat room feature. Users will also be able to find new games to play, discuss and learn about new content relevant to the game, and find others to play games together with one another.

## Structure

This project is divided into a frontend folder that is hosted on Amplify and a backend folder that will contain the code for our Lambda Functions as part of our serverless approach.

Inside the **frontend** folder, it will contain everything frontend related from all the React components, to hooks, frontend testing, and the CSS.
By itself, a person should be able to spin up a local version of our web app.

Inside the **backend** folder, it will contain all backend code that run on our Lambda Functions.
Refer to its own directory's README [here](backend/README.md) for more details.
