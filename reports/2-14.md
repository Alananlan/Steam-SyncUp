# 1. Team Report

This week we implemented a lot of code to get our applicationr ready for beta. We now have a basic messaging service. The lobbies API allows for creating, joining, leaving, and managing them and is partially integrated with the frontend. We have a messaging interface as well connected to our websockets. There is also a basic landing page and settings page that displays some user information.

The goal for the team meeting will be to reflect on the work we have done, figure out which areas we should prioritize to ensure the functionality provides a good user experience, and plan a roadmap for how we will improve our testing.

### Last Week's Goals

-   Connect frontend to backend for login
-   Load game data from users
-   Associate lobbies with games
-   Send/recieve messages in lobbies

### Progress and issues
