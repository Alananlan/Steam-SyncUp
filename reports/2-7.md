# 1. Team Report

This week we finished a basic testing framework along with CI. We also have a class that allows us to authenticate routes using JWT tokens. Our login flow also works.

Our project meeting will focus on coordinating all the features we want to finish for beta and dividing up the work.

### Last Week's Goals

-   Have the testing/CI section turned in by Friday 2/2
-   Have the barebone pages layouted and properly routed between each other
-   Continue learning the tech stack
-   Have basic testing and CI integrated into both the frontend and backend

### Progress and issues

-   We finished basic testing and CI
-   We turned in the CI section
-   We now have JWT token authentication on the backend
-   The login auth flow works

### Next Week's Goals
