# 1. Team Report

This week we all worked on finishing the architecture and design of the project. We also starting handing out tasks for implementing login, authetification, and the landing page. Additionally, future tasks such as the layout of the frontend were decided. Currently, we are working on CI and determining testing frameworks that we are planning to use.

This project meeting will focus on finalizing testing decisions and continuing to work on the testing/CI assignment. That will be the majority of the project meeting, but if there is additional time it will be focusing on combining the frontend and backend authetification services.

### Last Week's Goals

-   Have the architecture section turned in by Friday 1/26
-   Continue learning the tech stack
-   Have a the frontend for a simple login page deployed to Amplify
-   Have a Dynamo database configured to hold users
-   Have backend support in Lambda for creating/logging in the user

### Progress and issues

-   Finished the architecture and design for the project.
-   Set up authetification on the backend, need to integrate with frontend.
-   Continue learning the technology stack.
-   Learning about unfamiliar testing frameworks and choosing the best CI platform.

### Next Week's Goals

-   Have the testing/CI section turned in by Friday 2/2
-   Have the barebone pages layouted and properly routed between each other
-   Continue learning the tech stack
-   Have basic testing and CI integrated into both the frontend and backend

## Eric Hoelscher

### Last Week's Goals

-   Learn more about the techlogy stack we are using
-   Have a working dev environment
-   Push to GitHub from the dev environment

### Progress and issues

I was able to achieve all of last week's goals. I have been learning about JWT tokens and have started adding some code for it. I realized that using HTTP-only cookies to store our tokens could lead to issues with authenticating our websocket events for the messaging service, so we may need to just use local storage for them.

### Next Week's Goals

-   Contribute to the pros/cons section of the writeup for CI
-   Implement a backend testing framework
-   Finish up and push some of the JWT code early in the week
-   Find the next task to make forward progress on implementation
