# 1. Team Report
This week we all worked on finishing the architecture and design of the project. We also starting handing out tasks for implementing login, authetification, and the landing page. Additionally, future tasks such as the layout of the frontend were decided. Currently, we are working on CI and determining testing frameworks that we are planning to use. 

This project meeting will focus on finalizing testing decisions and continuing to work on the testing/CI assignment. That will be the majority of the project meeting, but if there is additional time it will be focusing on combining the frontend and backend authetification services.
