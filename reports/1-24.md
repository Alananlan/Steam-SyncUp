# 1. Team Report

This week we all worked on learning the tech stack, finished setting up our GitHub repo, and began working on the archticture checkpoint. We all have an assigned role for that section and are working to finish it by Friday when it is due.

The project meeting will be focused on reviewing the architecture decisions we made in the requirements doc and making sure the pieces all tie together. The remainder of it will be to sync up on the progress for the login page and resolve any blockers on getting that deployed.

### Last Week's Goals

-   Begin learning the technologies we will use in our stack and plan out the architecture for our project as a team.
-   Have our GitHub repo set up.
-   Begin building the architecture for our product

### Progress and issues

-   Most of us were able to learn about the technologies through the videos Scott shared
-   We are all on the Git Repo and we have a working issue board
-   We divided up the components of the architecture section and are all working on our respective parts to complete it by Friday.

### Next Week's Goals

-   Have the architecture section turned in by Friday 1/26
-   Continue learning the tech stack
-   Have a the frontend for a simple login page deployed to Amplify
-   Have a Dynamo database configured to hold users
-   Have backend support in Lambda for creating/logging in the user
