# 1. Team Report

This week we wrote our feedback to give to the Husky Pal group. We made some improvements to our documentation as well. We improved the users api, and discussed more about our plans for finishing up the messaging service. This past week was a bit lighter as we had work for other classes to catch up on from the push to finish the beta release.

The goal for the team meeting is to coordinate everything we need to finish for our final release.

### Last Week's Goals

-   Add support for messaging in multiple lobbies
-   Finish integration with lobbies API in frontend
-   Polish messaging experience (e.g. add usernames instead of user IDs in messages)
-   Make landing page games clickable
-   Improve settings page (design and better info)

### Progress and issues

-   Improvements to the readme instructions for building/testing
-   Added ability to search any user in the users api
-   More planning for how we will execute messaging and final touches for project
-   Found a moderation library

### Next Week's Goals

-   Finish project for final release
-   Integrate messaging with lobbies
-   Add usernames to messages
-   Moderate messages with library
-   Connect landing page to lobbies search
-   Add buttons for leaving lobbies and banning users

## Eric Li

### Last Week's Goals
- Modify websocket API into golang
- Have websocket send message functioning to upload the message into lobbies Dynamodb

### Progress and issues
- Will try to write the messages sent through websockets into Dynamodb by altering the sendmessage function of our websockets
- Hopefully convert the sendmessage function into dynamodb

### Next Week's Goals
- Have multiple lobby chats going on at once, probably by changing the changing connect route to possible upload the connectID
  into a lobby dynamodb table instead of the main connectionsID table holding all connections.
