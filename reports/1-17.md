# 1. Team Report

This week we finished up the first draft of the requirements doc and refined our vision for the project.

The goal for our team meeting is to nail down some of the specifics of the features we want in Steam SyncUp as well as set some goals for some actionable tasks. We will also begin setting up our repo and issues board.

### Progress and issues

-   We were all able to finish our assigned parts of the requirements doc and help each other review their parts and submitted the doc to Canvas.

### Next Week's Goals

-   Begin learning the technologies we will use in our stack and plan out the architecture for our project as a team.
-   Have our GitHub repo set up
-   Begin building the architecture for our product
